# Simple 3D Model Animator

## Run Commands

To run the application, run the following commands:

`npm install --global http-server`

`npm start`

## Future Scope

- To add GUI to the canvas to perform various transformations, camera view changes and perspective changes, instead of using many key bindings.
- To improve the method of choosing t1, as right now it is being hardcoded, though can follow other approaches such as taking up the central point of the curve etc.
